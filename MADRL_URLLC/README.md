# **Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning Scheduling using DDPG+Woltpertinger Algorithm**


## Overview

Using DDPG algorithm with woltpertinger architecture for large discrete action space. The base code has implementation for two mobile sub-networks. The parameters are chosen 
to ensure faster convergence. Hyper parameter optimization is required when the sub networks are increased. 

## Structure

_non_stationary_channel.py_ will generate a typical factory indoor environment with two sub networks, each having 4 devices. The small scale fading coefficients using Jakes channel model and 
path loss experienced data is saved. 

_Env.py_ contains the environment class
_model2_LSTM.py_ contains the actor, critic, state processing networks
_Main.py_ contains the training script invoking the environment and actor, critic, SPN networks.
